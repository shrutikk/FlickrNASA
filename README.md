# IBM_Code

* This application consists of a gallery for images from the Flickr API. Each page has 102 images (number chosen at random).
* Pagination is implemented to decrease page load time. 
* All the images are not fetched at once. When the page is changed, a new request is sent to fetch more data.
* Search Functionality: We can search for images with particular tags using the search button on the top right corner. To go back to the main page after search reload the page or click the IBM Flickr Code challenge on top
